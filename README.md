This is my first proyect with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) after having learned html, css, javascript from scratch.

This project was made with the intention of learning react and next.js

I still have many things to improve, such as the responsive design that it currently has, but only during the first render, not when the browser is resized.

to carry out this project use [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/)

You can see the result in [gutaku-guaynora.vercel.app/](https://gutaku-guaynora.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
